    <div>
        Arma 3 Exile is a game that takes players into a world that combines
        military tactics, stealth and, game play of prior mods before it with
        the Building and Trading merged in as well.
    </div>

    <div>
        &nbsp;
    </div>

    <div>
        With this in mind, being such a vast and complex array of Gameplay some
        Rules and Guidelines have been set and we require each and every player
        to READ these in order to play on the Server.
    </div>

    <div>
        &nbsp;
    </div>

    <div>
        (NOTE: These rules are subject to periodical changes due to the
        constant &#39;loopholes&quot; that present themselves, so please check
        back occasionally for updates. Feel free to send us feedback, we value
        it!)
    </div>

    </div>

    <h3 style="color:blue;">COMBAT LOGGING</h3>

    <div>
        Combat logging means that when you engage in combat and then log off in
        anyway and loose connection from the server.
    </div>

    <div>
        You are in combat only if you shoot, someone near you shoots, you ram
        your vehicle, or someone rams a vehicle on you - Accidentally or on
        purpose.
    </div>

    <div>
        If you witness a combat log you should report it in the Report a Player
        section of the forums. Video proof is the best when it comes to these
        reports.
    </div>

    <div>
        Excessive Combat Logging will Result in a timeout or a temp ban.
    </div>

    <h3 style="color:blue;">SAFE ZONES</h3>

    <div>
        Safe zones have been set up in order for players to conduct their
        TRADING under a safe non-combat environment, and we REQUIRE players to
        conduct themselves in a mature and timely fashion: e.g. conduct your
        business and move on, basically. Players may wait for a &quot;pick
        up&quot; in these areas and are to conduct themselves accordingly
        whilst doing so.

    <div>
        &nbsp;
    </div>

    <div>
        <strong>Glitching and Exploiting</strong>
    </div>

    <div>
        We do not allow any form of glitching or exploiting on our servers.
        Duping is the same as glitching and exploiting. Players caught
        glitching or exploiting will be removed from our servers. There are too
        many glitches and exploits to be fleshed out here, however, that does
        not mean just because it is not said in the rules that it isn&#39;t a
        glitch and/or exploit. A glitch is ANYTHING that SHOULD NOT happen but
        does.
    </div>

    <div>
        Glitching or exploiting into bases or any normally inaccessible areas
        in any way, shape, or form is against rules.

    </div>

    <ul>
        <li class="a">You cannot block off Military loot spawns. This includes
        any green military tower/barracks. (Full list of buildings will be
        poste at a future date. Left to admin discretion until list is
        posted.)</li>

        <li class="a">You may not build anywhere within 1000m of trader or
        trader cities. This includes safes and any other types of lockables. If
        even one corner of your base is less than 1000m away from the EDGE of
        the trader or safe zone, you are breaking the rules.</li>

        <li class="a">You may not block any major roads, or have any building
        components touching the paved road. An Tempest should easily be able to
        fit underneath any overpasses you build. Building on small dirt roads
        is fine.</li>

        <li class="a">The blocking off of entrances to barracks to funnel
        players across into a certain side is not acceptable either; it&#39;s
        unsportsmanlike and is a form of barricading.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color:blue;">Side Chat and Personal behavior</h3>

    <div>
        <strong>DO NOT</strong>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li class="a">Use voice in Side Chat. We have a public TeamSpeak server
        for players that are interested in using voice chat while they game. We
        have public channels for each server. Players are allowed to create a
        temporary channel that has a password if they so wish. The channel will
        delete itself as soon as the last person leaves. We have donator
        channels as well that are password protected and stay on the TeamSpeak
        server regardless of whether or not someone is within the channel.</li>

        <li class="a">Ghost in TeamSpeak. If caught, you can be removed from
        TeamSpeak.</li>

        <li class="a">Use any kind of Racist, Homophobic, or Discriminatory
        comments. It will not be tolerated, even if the remark is made towards
        a friend or in a joking matter. This includes comments regarding sex
        trafficking, pedophilia, necrophilia, and or any other touchy subject
        matter of the like.</li>

        <li class="a">Using Slang will get your kicked automatically from the
        server.</li>

        <li class="a">Be overly abusive towards another player. Shit talk
        happens; it is part of the game. Know when to call it quits.</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
        &nbsp;
    </div>

    <div>
        Topics such as politics, religion, and world events are bound to come
        up in side chat. These topics are very touchy and people can get worked
        up over them very easily. We suggest leaving such things out of side
        chat, however, talking about them is not against rules. Please take the
        discussion to another location besides side chat if you are asked to do
        so, even if it is by another player. We offer temporary TeamSpeak
        channels that can be password protected. These channels can be used as
        voice communication and they also have the ability to transfer text to
        ONLY the people in the channel via the chat box of TeamSpeak.
